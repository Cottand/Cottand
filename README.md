# Hi there

I am an eager Computer Science learner at [Imperial College](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing), and currently work at [Blockchain](https://www.blockchain.com/).

I like building things.

A notable project I am building along with [William](https://github.com/williamprofit), [Lancelot](https://github.com/lancelotblanchard), and [Kacper](https://github.com/KacperKazan) which you will not find here is [**DJStreamr**](https://djstreamr.com).
